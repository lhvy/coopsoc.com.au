        Being a first-year rep of the 2022 cohort has been nothing short of a spectacular time and learning experience. My personal goal was to ensure every Co-Op student in my cohort, has a place in the Co-Op family. Whether this meant being open sometimes quite literally 24/7 to anyone who needed a chat or hosting a cute event every week where anyone could just pause, connect and have some fun. In an official capacity with Kristina, I was organising the Merch and facilitated communication between new and older students to represent them in an executive role. I primarily went about this through forming individual connections, reaching out to as many people as I could and yes, A LOT of google forms.
        
        Why I am applying:
        I see my fellow CoOps as family, that's what it comes down to, whether it's a simple dinner or a crazy night dancing our hearts out. The memories, moments and relationships from CoOp Soc will always have a special place in my heart. CoOp Soc is a community of love, compassion, everlasting moments and relationships. It would be a tremendous honour and privilege to make more memories for us all!`

        On top of that, being part of the Pubs/IT subcommittee this past year was eye-opening in a lot of ways.

My interest in Charity was planted when I took the Investing For Charity trainee analyst program during term one, where my group ended up making it to the case comp final. Social justice has always been important to me, in-fact, charity has allowed me to be in a position to get Co-op. I believe Co-op Soc especially would benefit from a strong advocate for charity, as while many of us believe that corporations and social business will lift quality of life, there are always people left behind.
        in terms of qualifications... I have had VALUABLE experience working within the house committee at Colombo house UNSW (my home for this year) as the social director,  This experience has taught me how to manage a subcommittee, work within a UNSW society, and most importantly, run fun events! thus, it is logical that I move onto the similar, and arguably better portfolio of Charity within Co-op, (my second home).`

        I have been given a lot by this community and would love the opportunity to give back to it as your 2023 marketing director <3
        
        As a member of the mkt subcomm this year, I’ve contributed to a lot of incredibly fun initiatives including our Co-op Soc pet Tik Tok series and adding video to the cruise promotions! This experience has also given me familiarity with the processes of subcomm, which will allow me to ensure that the great work done this year will be replicated in 2023, and to make informed improvements next year (e.g. pushing for more in-person meetings to form a tighter-knit team).`

In particular, I would like to focus on the issue of mental health, especially in Australia, where it is the leading cause of death for individuals aged 15 – 44. To help the cause, I took part in the StepUp and StampOut Suicide Campaign, which was a fundraising campaign which involved frequently going on walks and hikes to generate funds. I also delivered a speech for my school to raise awareness for mental health, which I was told sparked further conversations from teachers and students.  Through this role, I'd like to bring awareness to these issues.

        "description": `Hi guys! Here's why I am applying for the Co-op Co-charity director (yes lots of Co's). My interest in Charity was planted when I took the Investing For Charity trainee analyst program during term one, where my group ended up making it to the case comp final. Social justice has always been important to me, in-fact, charity has allowed me to be in a position to get Co-op. I believe Co-op Soc especially would benefit from a strong advocate for charity, as while many of us believe that corporations and social business will lift quality of life, there are always people left behind.
        in terms of qualifications... I have had VALUABLE experience working within the house committee at Colombo house UNSW (my home for this year) as the social director,  This experience has taught me how to manage a subcommittee, work within a UNSW society, and most importantly, run fun events! thus, it is logical that I move onto the similar, and arguably better portfolio of Charity within Co-op, (my second home).`

        "description": `Hi! Being a part of the charity subcom this year has shown me the potential that every individual has to positively contribute to their community with their unique skillsets. I’m running for Charity Director because I want to be able to encourage others to generously use their time to promote awareness for any cause they are passionate about and ultimately be able to foster a community that is eager to actively serve others. 
        I have always been ready to participate and organise charity events during both my short time at uni and also during high school where I have run fundraiser events and service weeks to support organisations such as The Starlight Foundation and Macleay Vocational College.  
        So, I would love to keep on creating events that can gather the co-op family together while also continuing to learn what giving back to the community means. 😊`

        "description": `It was through Co-op Society I discovered a wholesome community filled with both opportunity and fun – I think all the friendships and memories I’ve made along the way, university stress and some specific parts of camp included, has only made me more grateful to everyone. Perpetuating this friendly culture and being part of the team which helps it grow is one of the main ways I hope to give back to this society in the future.

        On top of that, being part of the Pubs/IT subcommittee this past year was eye-opening in a lot of ways. I had insights into the different ways different portfolios operate and implement new initiatives, experiencing again the importance of communication and open-mindedness in teamwork. It was exciting to see projects come together, and this only serves to further the motivation and passion I plan to display as Pubs Director/Treasurer :)
        
        Thank you everyone for an amazing year!`

Co-op Soc has been an incredible community for me - it's offered me amazing friends, incredible events, and many cherished memories despite my short time in it. I would like to give back to that amazing community in the way I'm most capable of - through IT. That's why I'm running for Co-op Soc's IT Director position.`
