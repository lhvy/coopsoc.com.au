                The UNSW Co-op Society is a club facilitated by and for students studying under the UNSW Co-op Scholarship Program. 
                We aim to create a sense of community amongst the inspiring group of young scholars that partake in this program, 
                further enriching the university experience of all Co-ops! We strongly encourage all Co-op scholars to join and get involved!

                We host a wide range of events throughout the year coordinated by our Social and Charity portfolios, 
                including a peer mentoring program and camp to transition first-year students into university, 
                an annual ball, and numerous charity events such as City2Surf and The Worldâ€™s Greatest Shave since 
                our merger with the Co-op Soc Charitable Society (CSCS) in 2018.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Our publications of ongoing projects and works conducted by Co-op scholars and alumni facilitate the 
                opportunity for students to interact with sponsors and industry leaders. The highlight publication 
                is our very own podcast; The Chicken Coop!
